        <h1>Totally messed up behaviour that's fine in the world of casual dating.</h1>
		<img src="img/relationships.jpg" alt="couple sat together">
		
		<h2>SORT of seeing someone but sort of not? You can get away with these behaviours that would be otherwise unacceptable:</h2>
		
		<h3>Ghosting</h3>
		<p>Had a decent enough time with someone but want to call things off? Simply never text them again, block their number, and blank them if you bump into them in the street. It's easier than letting them down gently like a decent human being, and thanks to the low bar that's been set nobody would be that surprised.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		
		<h3>Technically cheating</h3>
		There's nothing wrong with sowing your oats so long as everyone is on the same page. But if you've been seeing the same person semi-regularly for weeks or months, you know deep down that you're cheating if you're shagging someone else on the side. After all, if you didn't feel guilty about it you'd have no problem with telling them, right?<br>&nbsp;<br>

		<h3>Lovebombing</h3>
		By its nature, casual dating relies on forming a good impression quickly in order to impress other people. And whereas most people create grotesquely inaccurate dating app bios in order to turn heads, it's also acceptable to charm the pants off someone until they sleep with you. Then they'll ask you to leave as you finish.<br>&nbsp;<br>

		<h3>Stringing people along</h3>
		You haven't heard from your crush for weeks, which you're taking as a sign that they've got bored. Then they'll text 'thinking of u' at midnight to reignite your interest, after which they'll give it a fortnight before replying to your pathetic flurry of messages. If anyone else was this inconsistent with their communication you'd bin them.<br>&nbsp;<br>

		<h3>Not committing to anything</h3>
		Everyone hates a flake, but thanks to the endless possibilities of potential partners who are only a few right-swipes away, nobody has the ability to commit to anyone. The result: a bunch of depressed, horny singletons drifting through the world in search of love while also wrestling with a fear of missing out. No wonder the birth rate is plummeting.<br>&nbsp;<br>

        <h1>Adult Education</h1>
		<img src="img/childhood.jpg" alt="two young boys playing football">
		
		<h2>YOUR greatest achievements occurred during childhood. But strangely none of them are highly valued in adult life. Weep as you remember the pointless effort you put into these.</h2>
		
		<h3>Bronze survival</h3>
		<p>Weeks spent diving for rubber bricks and towing a 'drowning' child to safety. Since then you've had no chance to use these skills. Really you should be allowed to push someone into a canal just to save them. Although there's a danger you could only do it in a completely calm, heated swimming pool and it might turn into murder.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		
		<h3>Cycling proficiency</h3>
		Basically more work after school studying the highway code and living in terror of not being in exactly the right position for a right turn as you made a hand signal like a wanker. Later you discovered anyone can cycle on the road without a test. Everything you believed was a lie, and you've - rightly - never trusted another human being ever since.<br>&nbsp;<br>

		<h3>Being good at football</h3>
		The Action Man and Star Wars ranges had tokens for more toys. It was incredible when your 'free' thing arrived a mere six weeks later, after your mum paid a fortune in postage. So 35 years later, do you own priceless rare figures that would buy you a house? Nope. You've got the Rancor Keeper from Return of the Jedi, basically a fat, shirtless man in what appears to be a nappy.<br>&nbsp;<br>

		<h3>Computer game expertise</h3>
		You excelled at Spectrum or Commodore games, not from natural aptitude but spending a psychopathic amount of time hammering away repetitively at Manic Miner or Elite. Fat lot of good it did you. You're not even a games tester, much less a real space pilot. It's almost as if The Last Starfighter was deliberately designed to tap into young boys' fantasies. The cynicism is disgusting.<br>&nbsp;<br>

		<h3>Winning a competition</h3>
		Not Young Musician of the Year, obviously. More likely making a hat for your primary school Christmas party and winning first prize of a Toblerone. But you'd never recreate that raw adrenalin rush of success, and since then your life has been a series of miserable failures like an attractive partner, terrific kids and a really good job.<br>&nbsp;<br>

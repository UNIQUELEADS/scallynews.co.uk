        <h1>Half-term giving parents lockdown flashbacks</h1>
		<img src="img/stressed.jpg">
		<h2>THE half-term holiday is triggering the PTSD parents developed during last winter's unbearable lockdown, they have confirmed.</h2>
		<p>Across the UK, parents are responding to requests from children to 'make a rocket out of a Coke bottle like on YouTube' by falling to their knees and clawing at the sky like Charlie Sheen in Platoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>

Mother-of-three Jo Kramer said: "I thought it was all behind me but a few days in the house and I'm back there, back in that eternal winter lockdown I never truly left.<br>&nbsp;<br>

"The screams of children fighting over an Xbox controller. The splatter of rain against the windows. The suffocating boredom. Walking purposefully upstairs to scream into a duvet.<br>&nbsp;<br>

"I knew it was all a dream; the vaccine, the opening up of society, the flowering of hope. Once you've slammed into cold, hard reality like I did those three months it never leaves you. Happiness is an illusion indulged in by the weak.<br>&nbsp;<br>

"They say 'it's only a few days'. Bollocks. Once again I'm a caged animal, circling my own offspring, wondering who will be the first to strike."<br>&nbsp;<br>

Husband Andy Kramer said: "What's that? I've been out at work. Hey, who fancies a jigsaw?"</p>

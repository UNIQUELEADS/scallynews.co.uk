        <h1>I slept with a ghost, and other stories in downmarket women's magazines</h1>
		<img src="img/ghost.jpg">
		<h2>PERUSING Take A Break and its ilk in Tesco? Brace yourself for these utterly insane stories: </h2>
				<h3>I slept with a ghost</h3>
		<p>
		If you've been on the fence as to believing whether ghosts exist or not, why not let a story about a care worker from Hull who thinks they made love to the spirit of a Victorian coal miner convince you? Rather than suggesting this person simply had some depraved sex dream, the magazine reports it as solid, unshakeable fact.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		
		<h3>My husband is my brother</h3>

			Without fail, there will be a story about a couple who are, in some way, related by blood. The gold standard is when they find some lunatic who met and married someone, discovered they were a long-lost sibling and decided to remain together. Even incest can't stand in the way of true love.<br>&nbsp;<br>

		<h3>My cat is Hitler reincarnated</h3>

			This story will feature a photo of the owner solemnly holding up a white cat that has a patch of black fur on its upper lip. The only other evidence there is for this outlandish claim on is that the cat once scratched a gay friend of theirs. The only logical conclusion: it's the reincarnation of Hitler.<br>&nbsp;<br>

		<h3>My guinea pig is psychic</h3>
		Psychic animals are always popular, as this story about a guinea pig that munches on lettuce just before a tragic incident occurs will demonstrate. No one points out that guinea pigs munch lettuce multiple times a day so it's all just a coincidence. That would be far too level-headed and reality-based.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		
		<h3>I farted for 100 hours</h3>
			Rather than treating such a story with the hilarity it deserves, a red-top mag will report it very seriously and feature a picture of the farter looking sad and pointing at their bum. It's hugely embarrassing to admit to the nation that you have such a terrifying intestinal issue, but at least you've got £250 and something to show the grandchildren in years to come.
